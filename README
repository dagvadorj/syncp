<h1>syncp Server</h1>

This is the server implementation for the SyncP protocols
<h2>SYNC</h2>
<p>After having a SYNC verb from the client, the server compares the 
incoming synchronization time (sync time) to its modification 
time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the modification time is greater than sync
    time, the server sends changes (PUT and/or DELETE) fresher
    than the sync time. Finally, the server sends UPDATE command
    with its sync time i.e., the modification time.</li>
  <li>
    If the modification time is equal to sync time, everything 
    is up-to-date. Send server FINE.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PUT and DELETE</h2>
<p>The client is telling the server to freshen up its content.</p>
